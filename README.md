# RSGLthread
Single headerfile library for making simple threads, will be multiplatform in the future. Made mainly for RSGL but it can easily be for anything.

how to install (linux) (make)
```
sudo make install
```
run `make` for other make commands such as updating

to install it without make just move the headerfile to your RSGL directory

If your RSGL directory is not at `/usr/include` you'll have to do self install

```
cd RSGLthread
cp RSGLthread.hpp /path/to/RSGL
```
